# Advent of Code 2023

## Setup

    npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node

## Run a challenge

    cd day01
    npx ts-node index.ts

## Notes

* Day 8 part 2: a bit annoying. It's not explicit but the problem statement hints: for each starting point the path will have a full cycle after reaching a terminal point. So the problem really wants you to find the least common multiple of those cycle lengths.
